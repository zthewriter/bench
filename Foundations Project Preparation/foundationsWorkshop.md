# Foundations Frameworks

These notes come from the [Foundations Workshop deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13neYJyIpHsdPmZb0vP_UOlERnGINn3mx4aokWE_4EpM/edit#slide=id.g1d1064e6b7_0_0) and the primary focus is how a Technical Writer can contribute to a Foundations project. 

## Goal 

Demonstrate how a TW can contribute to a Foundations Workshop. 

## Opening quote 

Including the deck quote here, because I find it particularly relatable and inspiring: 

```"The hardest part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build." - Fred Brooks``` 

## What is it? 

### Discovery Workshop

**Structured meeting** in which a carefully selected group of **stakeholders** and **content experts**:
- Define 
- Create 
- Refine 
- Reach closure 
on deliverables (such as models and documents) that **represent user requirements.** 

>**What are user requirements?**
User requirements are features the users need the software product to support, and **system requirements** are features the software product needs the host environment to support. User requirements are requirements set by the end user. 

"One of us is not as smart as all of us."

It taps the collective wisdom of the group, and this requires collaboration and facilitation. 

## Why have it? 

### Get the Right Ones Right 
- Failing to get requirements right, or to get all the right requirements, leads to enormous costs of reworking mistakes. 
- Software suppliers risk losing customers or market share when they deliver software that does not match the users' needs, which means business is at risk. 

### Difficulties with Requirements 
- A diverse group of users and stakeholders may have conflicting needs
- Software organizations must have tools and techniques for negotiating and prioritizing requirements. 
- A balance between feasible delivery cycles and customer demands needs to be reached. 
- Some requirements take precedence over other for architectural reasons, something that business people generally don't have the experience or knowledge to understand. 
- Lack of involvement and participation of the right people. Business people need the software, but often they don't invest the time to define their needs. 
- Customers do not provide the right domain experts to specify user requirements 
- Listening closely to the voice of the customer isn't easy if you're focused on software internals. 
- Communication gaps between software and business people. Each side uses its own acronyms and jargon.  

### Consequences of Poorly Defined Requirements 
- Building the product right rather than building the right product. 
- Scope creep (also called requirement creep) in project management refers to changes, continuous or uncontrolled growth in a project's scope, at any point after the project begins. This can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled. It is generally considered harmful. 

Clarification and prioritization are key. 

### Benefits of Discovery Workshops 
- Nurture: 
  - Team communication 
  - Decision making 
  - Mutual understanding 
- Increase users'
  - Commitment to the requirements definition.
  - Ownership of the deliverables. 
- Bridge communication gaps. 
- Expedite mutual learning and understanding. 
- Strengthen customer satisfaction because customer participates in defining their needs. 

### Collaboration doesn't just happen 
- Collaboration must be engineered into a team's work. 
- Participants should include a healthy mix of business and software people 
- A key element of **successful collaborative** workshops is that the participants agree ahead of time to: 
  - The workshop purpose 
  - Principles for participation
  - Decision-making process
  - Products 

## What to do?

### Before 

#### Ensuring basic information
- Identify key participants: 
  - From Wizeline 
  - From the client organization 
- Ask:
  - How is Wizeline's relationship with the client? 
  - What is the scope? 
  - What are the outcomes? 
  - What information do we need? 
  - What documents will be delivered? 
  - **What is expected from me as a TW?**
#### Getting Ready 
- Research about
  - The organization 
  - The project 
  - The agenda 
- Prepare work: 
  - Documents 
  - Slide decks 
  - Workshops 
  - Templates for documentation 
- Prepare trip:
  - Transportation tickets 
  - Meeting point 
  - Location of workshop 
  - Weather 
  - Expensify account 
  
  ### During 

 - Positioning statement 
 - View [Foundations Workshop deck slide 21](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13neYJyIpHsdPmZb0vP_UOlERnGINn3mx4aokWE_4EpM/edit#slide=id.g5256ed8611_0_223) for a positioning statement example that includes the what, who, problem, benefits, alternatives, and outcome  
 - Press release 
 - Press release structure (slide 23)
 - Press release guidelines 
 - Press release example 
 - Conducting interviews
   - Identify the topic and scope 
   - Define interviewees 
   - Prepare questions 
   - Explain the purpose of the interview
   - Obtain permission for recording 
- Premortem 
  - What kind of things can make the project go terribly wrong? 
  - What kind of things can make the project succeed?
  - Steps: 
    - Split Architecture: Failure Team and Success Team 
    - Vote for the top three outcomes, that are opportunities you can influence and control 
    - Design a plan and assign owners to each top related risk or opportunity 
- **Documenting**
  - What to document? 
    - Meetings: decisions, agreements, considerations 
    - Interviews: findings, problems, needs 
    - Workshops: findings, problems, needs
  - What to document? 
    - The outcome will be the base for the document to be delivered 
  - How to document? 
    - Audio recording 
    - Video recording 
    - Notes 
    - Pictures   
  - Adapting to the situation 
    - Be flexible 
    - Be prepared to do whatever is needed
