# Documentation Basics 

## Information Architecture 

**Information Architecture** (IA) is the process of structuring, organizing, and categorizing content for a document. 

## Why is Information Architecture Important? 
- Helps users understand the content and use it efficiently 
- Establishes a path for users to obtain the information they need 
- Provides structure and nomenclature for the content 

## Concepts of IA
- Structure 
- Categorization 
- Search 

## Approach to Documentation 

We have different types of documents we make and each has their own focus in mind: 
- **Tutorials:** Learning-Oriented 
- **How-To Guides**: Problem-Oriented 
- **Explanation:** Understanding-Oriented 
- **Reference:** Information-Oriented 

Tutorials and How-To Guides are both focused on describing practical steps. How-To Guides and Reference documents are what a developers needs when coding for example. Reference Guides and Explanation Guides are both related to theoretical knowledge. Tutorials and Explanations are most useful when we are learning something new. 

## Best Practices for IA 

1. Understand your users 
2. Categorize content clearly 
3. Keep your documentation simple 

## Steps to Keep in Mind 

- Define the most important taks 
- Assess the existing materail 
- Create an outline 
- Speak to the stakeholders 
- Divide your document in short assignments 

## How to Structure the Content? 

- Put important information first 
- Organize information into clear categories 
- Know your audience 

## "Chunks" of Information 

Digestible units of information (usually 7 chunks)

- A "chunk" is a digestible unit of information 
- Information is broken down into pieces to improve the retention of the reader 
- Descriptions or instructions comprise a set of information "chunks". 

## Types of Structures 

- Linear: There is a beginning, middle, and end. There is a dependency on the first actions. 
- Non-linear structures: There is no need for dependency. For example, online structures. 

## Structuring Pieces of Information 

To structure your content: 
- Divide information into units 
- Create a hierarchy based on the audience 
- Define the objective to set the structure of the document 

## How to Categorize Content? 

- Find the relationships between the topics 
- Identify categories according to your audience needs 
- Establish multiple levels of categories 

## Categories Development 

1. Examine the content 
2. Keep the relevant content 
3. Group and label 

## How to take advantage of storytelling? 

- Define a protagonist - audience 
- Define a setting - context, what does the application do
- Define a premise - overview of your document 
- Define a clear starting and ending point - define the tasks that will be performed and how long 
- Break down your story in scenes

## Users Guides 
- Instruct end users on how to use the software solution 
- Uusally arranged as a series of ordered steps and might also include screenshots of the user interface (UI) to illustrate some elements' location.

The Audience is everyone 

## Administration Guides 

- Present information related to the operation and maintenance of an installed system 

The audience is the Administrator
