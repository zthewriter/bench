# What is Foundations?

## The Official Definition

Essential project elements that help us scope fix-bid projects accurately, set better expectations, and set delivery teams up for success.

## The Practical Definition 

A set of workshops that help us: 
- Understand the client's business 
- Identify the client's needs and requirements 
- Delimit the client's possibilities 

## Why does Wizeline offer Foundations?

All the Foundations are different, all the Foundations have the **same goal:** To build the **best possible solution** for our clients. 

## Why? Two potential outcomes for a Foundations project. 

- Foundations as a **stand-alone product** from Wizeline
- Foundations as a **starting phase** of a project 

The only **product** there is is the **outcome of the Foundations.** And, the outcome of the Foundations is a **document.** And we are the **owners** of that document as Technical Writers.

## How can I contribute as a Technical Writer? 

### How?
Before: 
- Ensure **basic information** from both sides Wizeline and the client (for example, key people). 
- Get familiar with the different artifacts available in the **Foundations Playbook.**
  - Know the different artifacts of a Foundations project 
    - An **experience canvas** is a type of artifact in a Foundations Project 
    - Other examples include: 
      - Positioning Statement  
      - Assumptions & Validation Plan 
      - Diagrams 
**NOTE:** There are MANY artifacts in a Foundations project. You need to get familiar with them prior to starting your project. Some of them (not all) will be included in your foundations. 
- Ask for the **agenda, slide decks, and existing documentation**
- Ask for the **SOW**
  - SOW stands for STATEMENT OF WORK 
  - It is a contract. It establishes what are the responsibilites of Wizeline, and it states what Wizeline  will deliver to the client.
  - The contract states the final deliverables, and the final deliverable is the document the Technical Writer is responsible for 
  - **The SOW includes all the specifications that your final document as the Technical Writer will include**   
- Confirm your **allocation time**
  - Confirm how much time you have on the project 
  - For example, if they try to only give you one week, you will not have enough time to finish the deliverable. At that point, you need to negotiate and clearly state what you can finish in that amount of time. 
- Prepare your **trip** 

There are different roles during a Foundations project. These roles include:
- Technical Writers 
- UX Designers
  - They design how the solution will look like for the end user  
  - The most important role during a Foundations project, because they are     the owners of the workshops 
- Delivery or Sales representative 
  - There to see how the negotiation is going 
  - See how the final product will look like 
- Solution Architect 
  - They hold similar responsibilites as UX Designer, BUT the main difference is that they are responsible for the **technical part** of the solution 
  - Designs how the solution will work technically, for example the design of how the databases, API calls, frontend, backend, etc. 

So, you need to identify who from Wizeline is on the project, and also you need to identify who is working with the client. For example, who are the stakeholders that are going to be there (as in present throughout the project). 

### During 
- Document everything that csn br documented: 
  - Notes
  - Daily Recaps 
  - Daily Wrap-Ups 
  - Specifications/Designs 
- Raise your hand for **(these are volunteering opportunities to let team members know what is within your scope)**: 
  - Interviewing 
    - UX Designers interview individuals related to the project to get more information. An example of what a Technical Writer can do is participate in the UX Designer's interviews and take notes on the questions asked and the answers.
  - Proposing ideas 
    - You can propose that you document certain diagram artifacts 
  - Digitalizing artifacts 
    - Digitalizing the contents of sticky notes 
- Be the owner of **(this is our biggest responsibility as TWs)**:
  - The documentation repo, useful links 
  - **REMEMBER YOU ARE THE OWNER OF:** The final document deliverable 
  - **Note:** You need to create a google drive for all the documents related to the project. For example, create a **Useful Links** document that includes all the links to different artifacts 

- On-site artifacts 
- Digital artifacts 
- **Documentation is the key** for the final deliverable 

### After 

- Ensure you have all the artifacts that are mentioned in the SOW. 
- Ensure you have the required information for your document OR continue working on the artifacts OR push the team to finish the artifacts 
- Propose an outline. Validate it with your team and, if possible, with the client. 
- Write, write, write! 

An example of a deliverable is a Google Drive with all the files related to the project. This includes the Foundatiion Framework, artifacts, notes, and links to all these external documents will be included within the Framework document. 

### Technical Specifications 

This is a document that includes all the technical information related to the project. It includes the Technical Design, the system architecture, and the technology stack. It also includes security, mainteance, databases, etc. 

The product document included what the porduct is going to look like. This includes screenshots of the prototype. Functional and non-functional requirements. 

Foundations Frameworks results includes all the artifacts and their explanations. 
For examples, assumptions and validation plan. 

Remember you can particpate, ask questions, and you can lead workshops. Don't just be a notetaker!
