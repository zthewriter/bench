## RESTful APIs
- A category of web APIs
- Web APIs define how software systmes communicate over the World Wide Web (WWWW)
- Web APIs use HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- Communication in HTTP centers around a concept called the Request-Response Cycle 

### Key concepts of RESTful APIs

These are: 
- Resource: Different types of information to access 
- Endpoint: End path to access a resource 
- HTTP Methods: The allowed interactions with the resource. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Authentication: Refers to proving correct identity 
- Authorization: Refers to allowing a certain action 

### API Parameters 

#### Path parameters 
Appear within the path of the endpoint before the query string, inside curly braces {}
#### Query parameters 
Appear in the query string of the endpoint after the questions mark (?). 

#### Header parameters 
Appear in the request header. The most common are Content-Type, Acccept, and Authorization. 
#### Request body parameters 

Appear in the request body (JSON or XML). 

## JSON Objects 

the most popular data format 

JavaScript object notation syntax 

- string 
- numbers 
- boolean 
- object 
- array
- null 

## API Documentation 

### Why is API Documentation important? 
- APIs main audience: software developers 
- If a documentation is not good, software developers will rather: 
  - Call help desk (which costs money to the company)
  - Give up and use another API from a different company 
- Good documentation ensures use of APIs and profits
