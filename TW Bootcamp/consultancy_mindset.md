# Consultancy Mindset Podcast Notes 

## Give the client more than what they asked for 

What is included in the contract is the minimum. It is not all that we can do. Take advantage of opportunities to deliver above and beyond services to clients. Identify potential needs the client may have. 

Reach out to your respective slack channel when you are confronted with a project channel. There is always someone with an answer who can help you. 

## How we start communication with the client 

How do we change the client mindset that is when I ask for x task to be done, I get x back. We want to expand on this and identify potential opportunities to give the client more.   

We are doing this from a point of collaboration.

I know you may not be used to being asked these types of questions, but if you give me an answer for this, I can deliver this. Learn more about the end goal. 

Always be respectful about it and come at it from a point of curiosity. 

The client usually provides documents regarding the project. The recommendation is to read all these documents and practice active listening. You will notice there are gaps in the information at times. Follow up on these goals with the clients. They will know you are listening and paying attention to the information they provided. 

Take the initiative to familiarize yourself with the project. Know what the client expects. 

Don't ask the client to redo work, but you can build upon previously asked questions to gain additional clarity. 

Ask your peers! Do not be too scared to ask questions. 

You need to build trust in the client and the Wizeline solution. Open communication is critical to the success of the project. 

## The Happy Path

The Happy Path is when we have an idea, propose the idea to the client, and the client says yes! 

But that does not always happen. In situations where that does not happen, how do we handle that rejection? 

"How can we deal with rejection?" 

**Tip 1**: Understand *why* it was rejected.
- Document those rejections and the whys 
- Learn from past mistakes for future project proposals 

**Tip 2**: Stakeholder interviews 
- When you get the opportunity to meet with the stakeholders you can ask them questions:
- Ask them: What is your vision or idea of success? 
- Follow up with this question: What other efforts have you done in the past to achieve this success? What worked and what did not work? 
- If you have differing views from someone on the team, 

## On projects where we are told to do things 

Sometimes clients only specify the solution and tell you to do something, and don't tell you the *problem*. 

Ask yourself: "What is the problem that they are trying to solve?" 

This will give you a better idea of the *best* solution. 

Maybe the client wants something that is not the best solution. Maybe you foresee a future problem. Try to identify the actual problem and offer the best solution to the client. 

**Remember:** You only have this additional context if you ask those questions to the clients. The fastest solutions aren't always the best.  

## Propose a different solution 

Keep the best interest of the client in mind throughout the project. We are not trying to push back against what the client wants, we want to push the client **forward**. 

Try to understand why a solution was proposed by the client in the first place. Get the full context! Build that counterproposal together! Identify the gaps and address those in the counterproposal that was collaboratively worked on. 

Pick your battles. Choose strategically to accept counterproposals from the client to build trust with the client that will help you add more to the project in the future. 

**Note:** Document all proposals and counterproposals. 

There is no one solution to the problem, there are many. Document *why* we chose the current solution we are working on. 

Key element for success: **patience**. 

Patience pays off. 

How do you accept criticism? How to accept positive and negative feedback? 

Go back to: how do you go above and beyond what you are supposed to do? The job description is the bare minimum. 

Communication, working as a team, experience vs expertise. 

## Post Meeting Notes 
**Note:** This section is a copy and paste straight from slack and is intended for my own personal reference. This way I do not lose these valuable tips. 

In slack, Eder Díaz said the following:

"Following on the topic of rejected proposals, I think it would be great to learn from others and start sharing those fails.
I can lead by example with a fail followed by a "kind of" win:
For context, we were at a time in the project where we were getting a lot of old bugs re-surfacing after every tweak we did to the system. Our proposal was to add unit tests and have a coverage of at least 80%. We did a document with the proposal basically mentioning that we might need a sprint to both setup and give a good starting point for the rest of the developers to follow up. The client didn't like the idea of setting their backlog back for a sprint (even though the time lost fixing old issues was more than that), they felt like this would set back the deliverables.
So we had to put that idea on the freezer for a while.
Some time later, and applying one of the best advices of the 2nd edition of the Refactoring book by Martin Fowler:
what do I tell my manager/client? don't tell (full quote on a thread)
we started doing TDD and having an internal unwritten rule of "if you touch it you should make a test".
That way we started to silently have less bugs and even more time to review and refactor our code changes and led to both a faster release of features and better developer experience.

Actually I think we didn't get to the percentage of coverage we proposed (we weren't even measuring or generating the coverage report). We basically ended up with great coverage on the most critical parts of the system and not so great coverage on the less critical or parts that "moved" the most.
On retrospectives we started getting kudos on speed and less bugs, we did mention that it was because we were doing more automated tests, and eventually we even got some "tech debt" sprints to work exclusively on stuff like this instead of backlog features."

**Note:** This section is pulled from the book 2nd edition of the Refactoring book by Martin Fowler word by word to reference in the text in the future:

"To a manager who is genuinely savvy about technology and understands the design stamina hypothesis, refactoring isn't hard to justify. Such managers should be encouraging refactoring on a regular basis and be looking for signs that indicate a team isn't doing enough. While it does happen that teams do too much refactoring, it's much rarer than teams are not doing enough.

Of course, many managers and customers don't have the technical awareness to know how code base health impacts productivity. In these cases U give my more controversial advice: *Don't tell!*

Subversive? I don't think so. Software developers are professionals. Our job is to build effective software as rapidly as we can. My experience is that refactoring is a big aid to building software quickly. If I need to add a new function and the design does not suit the change, I find it's quicker to refactor first and then add the function. If I need to fix a bug, I need to understand how the software work—and I find refactoring is the fastest way to do this. A schedule-driven manager wants me to do things the fastest way I can; how I do it is my responsibility. I'm being paid for my expertise in programming new capabilities fast, and the fastest way is by refactoring—therefore I refactor."
