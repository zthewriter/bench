# Software Development Projects 

A quick reminder:

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is composed of seven stages. These seven stages are: 
1. Planning 
2. Analysis 
3. Design 
4. Implementation 
5. Testing 
6. Deployment 
7. Use and maintenance 

## Types of Solutions Wizeline Offers

Software development solutions are diverse becuase technology service providers have multiple frameworks and strategies to solve a specific problem or need. We can categorize solutions as: 

### Software architecture 
- Frontend 
- Backend 

### Device orientation 
- Mobile 
- Desktop 
- Web 

### Service 
- APIs
- Databases 
- Data lakes 

### Computing environment 
- Cloud 
- On-premises
- Hybrid 

## Disciplines Involved 

Wizeline has a **product mindset** at its heart. Therefore, we implement a **multidisciplinary strategy** to build software development teams. 

Some of the benefits of this strategy includes: 
- Promote ownership of deliverables in every iteration
- Perform continuous release cycles 
- Provide timely feedback and avoid delays 
- Improve user experience and promote testing 
- Shorten the software development life cycle 

## Types of Projects 

"Projects are as diverse as the solutions."

### Foundations Projects 

The main goal of a Foundations framework is to lay the ground that will support a solution. 

Customers don't always have an idea of what they want or a prototype. 

Teams and customers accomplish a **shared mindset around the brand, the product, the business, and the technology.**

A Foundations project takes place in any of the three beginning steps of the SDLC (Planning, Analysis, ot Design).

Common deliverables for this type of project: 
- Workshop artifacts 
- Design prototype 
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition 
- Technical proposal with a high-level architecture 
- Document with findings and results 

**Note:** As Technical Writers, during a Foundations project we can write a document that keeps track of how we reach a solution and results and findings from the project. 

### Development Projects 

The goal of development projects is to build a product or platform following methodologies such as agile or waterfall. 

Multidisciplinart teams collaborate closely with customers in prioritizing the development tasks for every iteration. 

The main deliverable for these projects is the software up and running in a development environment. 

Common deliverables: 
- Product or platform in operation
- User documentation 
- Project documentation 
- Development documentation 
- Test cases 
- Architecture 

As Technical Writers, during these types of projects, we deliver relevant documentation for different audiences to complete the solutions. 

For example, we can write:
- User guide or manual 
- Understand why the project was built, how the team reached certain technical decisions, and how to onboard new members to the team 
- Software architecture 
- Deliver documentation for developers
  - API
  - Data strcutures 
  - Git flows 
  - Code conventions 

### Software Maintenance Projects 

The goal of maintenance projects is to make sure that the software is up to date and running successfully by performing: 
- Software updates 
- Improvements 
- Bug corrections 

Developers need excellent documentation to learn how to use and maintain the software quickly. 

Common deliverables: 
- Product continuity plan
- Code fixes 
- Troubleshooting and technical support 
- Release notes 
  - The documentation that helps end users know the latest new features and bug fixes of the latest release 
- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 


### Other Projects 

Wizeline can also provide specialized teams for specific customer needs. 

Other projects include the following:
- Staff augmentation 
- Consultancy 
- Advanced analytics 
- Data governance 
- Automation 

When starting a new project, as a TW:

1. Establish yourself within the team and make sure your prescence is known by others. What you do, what you don't do.
2. Take meeting notes 
3. Single Source of Truth document 
4. Ask, ask, ask

Ask your colleagues, teammates, stakeholders, and subject matter experts (SMEs). 

Request documentation reviews with sufficient time. 

## Documentation Needs 

Documentation is customized and depends on the type of project.

Technical writers dig deep into the project and customer needs to identify the most helpful documentation. 

### Use your tools 

Our own tools: 
- Interviews with SMEs and stakeholder 
  - Must have and nice to have documents 
- Assessment of current internal documentation
- Proactivesness and active listening during meetings 

### Understand tge Customer and the Product 

The following actions help to understand customers and products:
- Try and test the product or every released feature. 
- Read available documentation. 
- Familiarize yourself with the company, competitors, and industry. 
- Review UI and UX documentation and prototypes. 
- Identify key stakeholders and their role.

### Leverage Your Consulting Mindset 

TWs have a bigger impact when they practice the Consulting Mindset throughout projects and offer specialized advice on topics such as: 
-  Relevant documentation to complete the software 
-  Documentation gaps that customers may have 
-  Best practices to implement 

The following actions are part of the consulting mindset of a technical writer: 
- Conduct research and interviews
- Propose documentation solution to fill gaps 
- Prioritize documentation neesd along with the customer 
- Test the product to find vulnerabilities 
- Promote a documentation culture 

As a TW, you can review all existing documentation and test the product and provide the client with a **Documentation needs assessnent**. 

### Documentation Plan or Proposal 

After collecting tons of information, it is time to write a documentation plan or proposal. 

This document sets our goals for the project, helps align expectations, and highlights the relevamce of documentation.

This is one of the most common deliverables throughout the early stages of a project. 

The following are some tips you  can follow: 

- Youch base with your team constantly 
- Review documentation catalogs 
- Ask for a peer review 
- Prepare a presentation 

**Note:** This document is not mandatory, but if you have it, it can change throughout the project.

- Owner or owners of each document 
- Proposed table of contents for each document 

### Why?

Provide the following information:
- Relevance and goals of each document 
- The intended audience of each document 
- Importance of writing documentation along with the software development 
- Collaboration among disciplines 

### When? 

Provide the following information: 
- Roadmap with documentation milestones and delivery dates 
- Learning needs and a proposed deadline, if applicable

### Are you forgetting something? 

Don't forget to include a section with the following information:
- Assumptions 
- Dependencies

Include a mitigation plan given last minute changes to the project. 

### Bonus tip: Be Resilient 

Be resilient with your documentation plan or proposal and your deliverables: 
- Negotiate documentation plans or proposals 
- Change at the same spped as the development team 
- Grow your self-confidence 
- Learn from your mistakes 
- Reach out to your team for support and guidance
