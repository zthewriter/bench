## F-Shaped Pattern 

When reading online, readers usually: 
1. Read in a horizontal movement, usua;;y across the upper part of the content area 
2. Readers scan the first part of the following sentences - shorter in length. 
3. Readers do a final vertical scan to the bottom on the screen. 

Use the F-Shaped Pattern to your advantage: 
- Write for scanning not for reading 
- Use headings and lists to your advantage 
- Write for those who read; format for those who scan."
