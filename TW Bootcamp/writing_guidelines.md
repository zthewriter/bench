# Writing Guidelines 

## Design Your Document 

- Headings 
- Lead line 
- Paragraphs 
- Lists 

**Note:** Use white spaces actively. Thwy are part of your document design. 

The leadlin or topic sentence is the first line of every paragraph. It is also used as an introductory sentence. 

## About paragraphs 
- One idea, one paragraph 
- The topic sentence is the most important sentence 
- One topic sentence and three to five supporting sentences 

Good paragraphs answer the following three questions: 
1. What are you tryin gto tell your reader? 
2. Why is it important for the reader to know this? 
3. How should the reader use this knowledge? Alternatively, how should the reader know your point to be true? 

## Write Like a Pro 

**Passive voice example (the verb comes before the subject):**

Code is interpreted by Python, but code is compiled by C++.

**Active voice example (the subject comes before the verb):**

Python interprets code, but C++ complies code. 

**Note:** Active voice provides much mroe clarity to the sentence.
